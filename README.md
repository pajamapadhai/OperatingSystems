## Assignment Questions

1. What are the key design issues in modern Operating Systems? Provide examples for monolithic, layered, modular, and micro-kernel models.
2. Explain the difference between user and kernel modes. How do system calls facilitate interaction between the two?
3. Compare pre-emptive and non-pre-emptive CPU scheduling. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?
4. How can synchronization problems be solved in a concurrent system? Provide examples of classical synchronization problems and solutions.
5. Describe the concept of virtual memory and its importance. How does demand paging influence memory management?
6. Explain the key concepts of virtualization and its impact on operating system design. What are hypervisors and container virtualization?
